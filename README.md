# Open-Restreamer (Python)

ORP, is a free and opensource, self-hosted multicast restreaming service. The main idea is to solve my BIG issue with twitch never giving me quality selection, ergo me just streaming to many platforms at once, but I don't want to pay for anyone else's service to achieve this or settle for free 720p.
